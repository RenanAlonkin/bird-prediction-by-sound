# bird-prediction-by-sound

This project will be my personal exploration through the following topics:

- Web Scraping
- Inputting Data 
- Neural Networks

## current state

- Web Scraping (Progress: 95%)
  - Finding all birds from Lages/SC Region ✔️
  - Downloading at least 20 audio files of each bird ✔️
  - Create a method for it, in case someone wants to use it too
 
- Inputting Data (Progress: 60%)
  - Testing how to read audios in python ✔️
  - Testing how to create charts based on the audios ✔️
  - Transform all mp3 files into wav files
  - Find a way to create the metadata (read a file and say what class it belongs)
  
- Neural Networks 
  - Nothing done yet.
